#idea 

- A system that maintains a collection (live and/or static) of information, when provided by a query from users and returns some related pieces of information with source.
- Like Google but for neural search
- Need not to be on the whole web, but should work relatively general, for example: applicable for Wikipedia 
- Rank results by semantic relevant instead of "popularity" like pagerank

- Then move to a wiki-like site provider: let user build their own wiki-like site and browse the site with neural search
    - Locally, it's like obsidian with neural search
    - Online, it's like wikipedia with neural search
