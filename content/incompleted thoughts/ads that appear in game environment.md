Sport games already have this

why open-world games like gta, pubg don't have this ?

games that don't have a real world related environment can also have this, for example in dota: add can be put on the main UI where it makes sense, or even in game (add a logo of a brand inside the map but make it in dota style, like red bulls logo engraved in the rocks)
