#idea 

Taking inspiration from XNote

Name it wanda. You know, like a wand - wan-da

The presentation can go like this
- me: and we call it Wanda. You know, like a wan-da 
- someone: lame
- me: I know.
- also me: and the upgraded version is called Laim Wanda

Or:
- me: this is version 2, and we call it Wingadium Leviosa
- someone: it's levi ohhh sa, not leviosaaa
- me: I created it so I get to nameeee it
- someone: so lameee
- me: that's the point (point the pen towards them)
- me: (look at the pen and realized is a great pun) pun intended
