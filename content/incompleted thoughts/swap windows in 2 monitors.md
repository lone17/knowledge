#idea 

- base idea is to the positions and display areas of 2 windows
- then extend it to swap 2 windows which are displaying in 2 monitors
	- for example the user has 2 application open on 2 monitors
	- switching the 2 windows brings one app to the main monitor while still keeping the other visible on the other monitor
