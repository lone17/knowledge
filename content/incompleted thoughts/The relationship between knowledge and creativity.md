#thought 

I think I am creative and have a lot of ideas (quantity of creativity).

But I have this belief that my creativity and the quality of my ideas are limited by the amount of knowledge I have.

With limited knowledge, I don't k now what are possible.
- The more knowledge I have, the more materials I can use to come up with better ideas.

But there is a point of diminishing returns and eventually, a point of maximum yields, where more knowledge does not increase the quality of creativity and might even hurts it.
- Knowing more might increases the amount of things that I think are impossible.
- My "box" would become too big that it's hard to get out of.

But I'm still nowhere near that point.


#question 
If we plot creativity in the y-axis and the amount of knowledge in the x-axis, then will the relationship would be a concave function with a global maximum or a plateau region at the top ?
