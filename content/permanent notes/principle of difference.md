# What
a.k.a: **principle of sufficient reason**

It states that
> Â In the absence of any relevant evidence, agents should distribute their credence (or "degrees of belief") equally among all the possible outcomes under consideration

It basically means: ==If no relevant information -> assigning equal probability to all possible outcomes.==

In [[Bayesian statistics]], it gives the simplest non-informative prior ![[Bayesian statistics#^793b29]]
In [[frequentist statistics]], it is meaningless.
- because in [[frequentist statistics]], probabilities are relative frequencies rather than degrees of belief in uncertain propositions.
