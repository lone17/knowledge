# Frequentist probability
>a.k.a: **frequentism**, **long run probability**

An interpretation of probability as ==the limit of its relative frequency in many trials== (the **long run probability**)
- discussed only when dealing with well-defined random experiments:
	- sample space: the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment,
	- an event: a particular subset of the sample space to be considered
		- for any given event, only 1 of 2 possibilities may hold: occurs or not occurs.
- probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process
	- measured by the relative frequency of occurrence of an event, observed in a number of repetitions of the experiment.
- why many trials ?
	- to devoid opinion (ideally)
## Motivation
Motivated by the problems and paradoxes of the previous dominant viewpoint, the ![[classical probability]]
## Properties
- Entails a view that *probability* is nonsensical in the absence of pre-existing data.
- A claim of the frequentist approach is that, ==as the number of trials increases, the change in the relative frequency will diminish.== -> one can view a probability as the *limiting value* of the corresponding relative frequencies.
- It offers distinct guidance for how to apply mathematical probability theory to the construction and design of practical experiments, especially when contrasted with the [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian interpretation]].
	- As to whether this guidance is useful, or is apt to mis-interpretation, has been a source of controversy.

# Frequentist inference
- A type of statistical inference
- Based on [[#Frequentist probability]]
	- treats *probability* in equivalent terms as *frequency*
	- draws conclusions from sample-data by means of  emphasizing the frequency or proportion of findings in the data.
## Examples
- [[p-value]]
- [[confidence interval]]
- [[null hypothesis]] significance testing
