# what
A **_natural number_** can be represented as the **_sum of the squares of 3 integers_**
$$n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2$$
if and only if
$$n \not = 4^k(8m + 7)$$ for non-negative integers $k$ and $m$.

# properties
- can be used to proof [[Lagrange's 4-square theorem]], but it's harder to proof that a direct proof of [[Lagrange's 4-square theorem]].
