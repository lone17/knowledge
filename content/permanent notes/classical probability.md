# What
An interpretation of probability where probability is defined
- in terms of [[principle of difference]]
- based on the natural symmetry of a problem
	- e.g. the probabilities of dice games arise from the natural symmetric 6-sidedness of the cube.

This classical interpretation stumbled at any statistical problem that has no natural symmetry for reasoning.
