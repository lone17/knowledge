# Advices from Jonathan Frankle 
[source](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/take/training-fine-tuning-LLMs/lessons/49183080-q-a)
- _The most important topic and the things we understand the least. We know so little about evaluation and how to evaluate properly._ 
- _There aren't really best practice in the field._
- _If you have a process you're already integrating a model into, measure the model in the same way you measure success for that process._
- Go beyond loss
	- _Incredibly bespoke, use case by use case_
- Focus on success metrics specific to the task at hand.
	- _The general advice is try to get as close to the real world as possible, the rest is up to the domain expert._
