# what
Every **natural number** can be represented as a **_sum of 4 non-negative integer squares_**
$$
n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2
$$
where $n > 0$ and $a, b, c, d$ are integers.

a.k.a  [Bachet's conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BachetsConjecture.html)

# properties
- a special case of the [Fermat polygonal number theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_polygonal_number_theorem "Fermat polygonal number theorem").
- according to [[Legendre's 3-square theorem]], all 4 squares must be positive if $n = 4^k(8m + 7)$ for integers $k$ and $m$.
