A regular day that we are familiar to is a Solar day, but it is not a full rotation of the Earth. There is a thing called [[Sidereal day]].

And even [[The length of a solar day is not actually 24 hours]], it is just 24 hours on average.

Also, [[Earth rotation can't be used for time keeping]], because it's unstable that way.

Turns out, [[The Earth is slowing down]]. So a day is becoming longer.

There are many [[Things that change the rotation of the Earth]]. But all factor combines, Earth day has been increasing.
