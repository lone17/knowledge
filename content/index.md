Here lies the messy clump of my #thought, #idea, #personal/opinion, **knowledge** and **misknowledge**.

The notes here are a (partial) digital copy of what's on my mind. They are written for myself and are my thinking environment. So if you found them to be confusing, under-explained or disorganized, please kindly understand. üôè

There is basically **no navigation or structure** to this site. You might see some hierarchical structure on the left panel, but that was mostly a historical artifact. I initially intended to organize my notes in folders, but then I realized my thoughts doesn't work that way.

I also tried the [[zettlekasten]] system, so there are the [[permanent notes]] and [[literature notes]] folders. But I don't really use them any more. My notes are more random and chaotic than that, they are meant to be **incomplete and ever open for improvement**. I am not quite sure how to best organize them yet, perhaps that's just my skill issue. 

Nonetheless, I'm currently embracing the spontaneity and see how it goes. Notes are now like nodes in a graph, connected together via
- topics (using [tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags))
- shared concepts, facts and ideas (using [internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links))

You can think of it like the structure of [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org).

Though if you are interested in exploring, you can 
- make use of the search function
	- the search bar is located at the top of the left panel
	- or simply hit `Ctrl/Cmd + K` 
- click on any note on the left panel
	- then follow linked notes
- browse the graph view
	- the local graph view is located on the right panel
		- click on the small button in the top right corner to see the global graph
	- or search for `graph view`

I publish this site with the hope of **gaining knowledge**, if you know anything that might be of interest to me or find any flaw in my notes, please let me know in the comment section. 
- There is a comment section at the bottom of every note.
