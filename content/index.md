Here lies the messy clump of my thoughts, ideas, opinions, knowledge and misknowledge.

The notes here are a (partial) digital copy of what's on my mind. Those are written for myself and are my thinking environment. So if you found them to be confusing, under-explained or disorganized, please kindly understand.

There is basically no navigation or structure to this site. Though if you are interested in exploring, you can make use of the search button or simply clicking on any note on the left panel and follow the links.

I publish this site with the hope of gaining knowledge, if you know anything that mind interested me or find any flaw in my notes, please let me know in the comment section (there is one at the bottom of every note, but you will need a Github account to for that).
