#personal/interest

My interests lie in the broad topic of improving the modelling capability of Deep Learning models, which refers to anything related to information and knowledge representation, novel architectures and modelling paradigms, learnable causality and reasoning, effective and efficient training methods, etc. This includes but is not limited to topics such as Multimodality, Modularity, Representation Learning, and Causal Deep Learning. I consider myself to be intellectually curious and would like to dedicate my curiosity to good use.
