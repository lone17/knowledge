#personal/interest 

I like systems that have a simple, atomic, and general design.
- simple means having very few (should be 5 or under) core components/concepts
- atomic means components are modular and not coupled with others
- general means being extensible infinitely to supports complexity

Examples:
- obsidian: a local markdown editor that give you total control over your files.
    - [[how Obsidian is good for me]]
- nixos: linux with declarative configurations for everything.
