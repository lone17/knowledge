Motivated by the observations in 
![[Refusal behaviour can be controlled by turning a knob#Observations]]
![[Refusal behaviour can be controlled by turning a knob#Thoughts]]

- Directions representing related concepts might be packed into a low-dimensional subspace, for example
	- Refusal and harmfulness/ethicalness live in a 2D space
	- Emotions live in a 2D or 3D space as many pairs don't need to be orthogonal #hypothesis
		- would be nice to find a unit 3D sphere of emotions such that the emotion of the generation can be controlled by moving along that sphere
