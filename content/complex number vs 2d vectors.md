# intuition
- equivalence of dimensions
    - in 2d vectors, the dimensions are equivalent
        - which means you can perform operations that combine the dimensions together
    - in complex number, the real and imagine components are 2 non-equivalent dimensions
        - any operation will not combine them, which means the 2 components will still be separated
        - the only way to combine them is through multiplication by $i$, which acts as a gateway to go from one to the other
- complex number is like a special case of 2d vectors where only the operation that not combine the dimensions are allowed ? #idea #question ^171816
- parallel vs orthogonal dimensions
    - in vector space, dimensions are orthogonal (in the sense that their intersection is the lower dimension)
    - in complex number, the 2 components are like in 2 parallel dimensions #idea
        - even though they can be visualized as orthogonal
        - this is a new way of thinking about complex numbers
            - multiplication with $i$ means jump from one dimension to another
            - a combination of a real and an imagine parts is a level in between the 2 dimensions
            - the only intersection is 0, which can be thought of as the 2 parallel dimension that actually start from the same point #idea
                - this intuition might be useful in physics ? #question
                - maybe that's why it's used in describing general relativity and quantum physics ?
        - so maybe the [[#^171816|above question]] is wrong ?
        - maybe that why complex numbers make many maths problems simpler, because it unlocks access to a hidden parallel dimension
            - orthogonal dimensions are not locked, we live in a 3-d space so we used to think in orthogonal
            - but our mind is not familiar with parallelism
            - might be related to the idea of [[multiverse]]
            - we see orthogonal dimension with our eyes, but we need to "see" parallelism with our mind #quote
- k-d vectors of complex numbers = k orthogonal dimensions and 2 parallel dimensions
# questions
#question #idea 
- by the same logic, can we have 3 (and more) parallel-dimensional numbers ?
    - each dimension pair will have a special operation to "jump" between them
    - multiple orthogonal dimensions and multiple parallel dimensions
    - so can we use that to make complicated problems simpler, as it unlocks more hidden parallel dimension ?
    - or even discover more hidden problems ?
        - we understand reality and the universe better thus we have more complicated questions
