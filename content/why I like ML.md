I think I like ML because the papers are, for the recent past, mostly engineering and empirical oriented

they have lots of diagrams and I can quickly grasp the gist of it through a quick look, without needing to dive into the maths equation

not that I dislike the formal maths, but the fact that this field is pretty much intuition driven until now is a great gateway to get into the maths once the interest is sparked
