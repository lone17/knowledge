# what
- a set whose elements made of a field equipped with additive and scalar multiplicative operations satisfying some axioms related to linearity (or vector space axioms)

# intuition
- What commonly pops out of our heads when we hear vectors are arrays of numbers. 
    - In fact, it is an example of vector space, known as finite dimensional vector space.
    - Sequences also form a countably infinite dimensional vector space.
    - And functions from complete domain forms an uncountably infinite dimensional vector space.
