#thought 

Inspired from a comment from [this video](https://youtu.be/g4ecBFmvAYU?si=bsVs9LnWKgsjV_JI).


There's always a reason why we do something and when we are first introduced to new concepts, we are often given the how before we are given the why.

That suppresses curiosity and in turns suppresses learning.
