#thought #advice

It's feel so nice writing stuff down, it feels so liberating.

I did that unintentionally so many times before, why didn't I ever realize that ?

Letting my thoughts flow into the page so my mind no longer need to hold on to them.
It also allows me to better organizing my thoughts.

This turns out to be [[Writing to learn|a great learning technique]] used by many great minds.
