We don't fully understand the human brain.

We don't fully understand how neural networks work either.

So we are modelling something we don't fully understand and get another thing that we also don't understand.

This introduces a confusion which is we don't know whether if the modelling process is correct.

So studying neural networks to help us understand the human mind better is a paradoxical approach

But it is fascinating, since it involves 2 domains of unknown.

Though we take inspiration from the human brain, we might create new intelligence.
Which is not a bad thing.
