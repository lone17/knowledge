- I think I'm a nerd, and I also think that being a nerd is nice.

- I'm not good with words and expressing myself clearly, I am actively working on it, by writing my thoughts down and by talking to myself.
- I talk to myself a lot, which makes me seems weird sometime.

- I'm curious, sometime too curious, which is both a good thing and a bad thing
- I can be stubborn sometime, which does not pair well with being curious
- I'm not good at regulating my attention
    - If I find something interesting, I can easily get sucked into it

- I'm not very smart, and I'm trying to prove myself wrong

- I like to learn new stuff and to understand how things work.
	- Sadly I usually not smart enough for that

- I want to have a lot of knowledge, and someday become very knowledgeable in my field of work, which happens to be ML
	- for me this field is interesting because it's empirical and intuition-oriented

- I find joy in creating something that is intellectually novel and people enjoy using.

- I believe in the compound effect of small improvements, but I dream of making a big leap

- I like to think that I'm creative and have a lot of ideas
	- ![[how Obsidian is good for me#^dc3611]]
- but the quality of my ideas is limited by the lack of my knowledge 
	- [[The relationship between knowledge and creativity]]
- I am good at coming up with idea, but not with storing them.

- I enjoy experimenting with machine learning techniques and applying intuition and creativity to model development.

- I lean toward the ML/modelling itself more than toward its downstream applications.

- I like to ask *why* and *what if* questions, and I have more questions than I have answers to.
