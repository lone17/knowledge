# what
A statistical principle that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size get larger, regardless of the population's distribution.

sample mean = population mean 
$$\mu_\bar{X_n} = \mu$$
sample standard deviation = population standard deviation / square root of sample size
$$\sigma_\bar{X_n} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
