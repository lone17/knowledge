- Arithmetic mean ?
	- takes into account both direction and magnitude
- normed then arithmetic mean
	- only care about direction
	- but what about the magnitude of the mean vector ?
- project to 2 least principal components then project back ?
- project to 2 most principle components and take the average, then project back ?
- normalize before or after projecting ?
	- I think it should be before, to preserve the direction
