Which is to do things until I feel satisfied with the results.

Not to be confused with perfection. Perfection is the absolute best. Satisfactory is the best you can do within your ability, time and objective.

For example:
- I try to get 90+% on both time complexity and space complexity on every leetcode problem I do. Because my goal is to learn, and I know that I can understand most complex solutions for leetcode problems (they are nowhere near as hard as true CP problems like codeforces/IOI/ICPC). If it's not possible to get 90+% on both TC and SC, I will make sure I understand why it's not possible and then try to get 90+% on TC with best possible SC.
- When I make a presentation, I will try to make pretty slides. I can't stand ugly slides. The result is when I don't have enough time, the few first slides would be really nice and well thought out, and the others are just meh.
