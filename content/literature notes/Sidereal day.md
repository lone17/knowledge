# What
- _"Sidereal"_ means related to the stars.
- Time it takes for the Earth to rotate 1 full cycle is **23h56m4s**.
- That when the stars be on the same place in the sky.
# Why
- We don't base our lives on when stars return to the same spot in the sky, **we base our lives on when the sun returns to the same spot**.
- We need sunlight to operate and grow plants.
- When the Earth complete a revolution, it also moves a bit (almost 1 degree) along its orbit around the sun. => the sun not in the same spot but the stars still because they are very far away.
# Hence
- The Earth need to rotate a bit more so that sun get back to the same spot. => That's a solar day.
