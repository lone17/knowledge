Advices from Jonathan Frankle:
- Start small and work your way up.
	- ensure an end-to-end system for constant evaluation.
	- [[Chinchilla scaling laws]]
- Be skeptical of what you read in the literature. Test for yourself.
	_"Not everything you've seen in the literature is 100% reliable. And also not everything is going to translate to your setting, your domain and what you are working on."
- Don't trust intuition. Test for yourself.
	_"A lot of counterintuitive things happen in deep learning."_
- This is data science in its truest form.
	_"Test things for yourself. This really is science in its truest form and data science in its truest form and you're gonna have to be a scientist and follow scientific methods._
