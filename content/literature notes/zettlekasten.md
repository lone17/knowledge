a note taking system created by Nikas Luhmann
- a bottom-up approach
	- make notes first, connect later
	- save the notes and keep them there and see what comes out later
	- elevate a note into [[permanent notes]] dictates its categories 
	- intersectional/multi-disciplinary: seek connections between ideas without the restrict of putting ideas into folders

	- not trying to force ideas into folders/categories
