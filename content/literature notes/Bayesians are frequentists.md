Some take aways:
> Bayesians are frequentists. The Bayesian prior distribution corresponds to the frequentist sample space: it’s the set of problems for which a particular statistical model or procedure will be applied.

>Bayesian and frequentist inference are both about averaging over possible problems to which a method might be applied.

> any Bayesian interpretation of probability has to have some frequentist underpinning to be useful. And, conversely, any frequentist sample space corresponds to some set of problems to be averaged over.

> good Bayesian inference _and_ good frequentist inference are both about having a modeled population (also called a prior distribution, or frequency distribution, or reference set) that is a good match to the applied question being asked.
