# Vision
In the future, there will be a single piece of hardware that people can buy which is used specifically to run AI.  

This is an AI computer that users have at home and have all of their devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) connected to it via a network (e.g. the Internet).

It will act truly as a virtual assistant that sits at your home and interacts with your devices.

# Background
I view AI products will mature in 2 ways simultaneously:
- It will become more of a Client-Server paradigm: 
	- The server stays at home, hosts big AI models, stores user data and responses to request from the client.
	- The client lives in edge devices, interacts with the user, understands the user's intent, takes action on the user's behalf, and decides what to send to the server.
	- The client acts as a secretary and the server as an expert, together they make an assistant.
- It will become more holistic:
	- The AI will be integrated deeper into personal electronic devices, having access to more and more data from all aspect of the user's life.
	- It will also store past data, keeping track of a running record of the user's digital life.
		- It should also be smart enough to know what to store, what should be "remember" short term and long term, what's important and what's not.
